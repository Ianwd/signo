            <h3>The origin of signo</h3>
            <p>
              Born out of a lack of information or clarity in the field of screen accessibility, signo has been developed in a month.
            </p>
            <p>
              signo encloses information which was gathered among many publications, such as W3C, WebAIM, Medium, Orange, Microsoft, Material.io, etc. This knowledge was rewritten in order to be easily understandable, and served in a way which aims to be widely spread.
