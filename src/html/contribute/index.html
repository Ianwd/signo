            signo was built in the objective of being a robust base that can expend easily according to users contributions. Because open and shared knowledge is a key to our society and expending intelligence, we allow anyone to submit contributions.

            Indeed, you must have a bit of Git knowledge in order to make a pull request and to understand the way a Version Control System works. If you don't have this knowledge, don't worry, just head to the web for a tutorial. <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html">This one from Roger Dudler</a> is pretty simple and available in multiple languages.
