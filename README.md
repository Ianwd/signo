# signo

Born out of a lack of information or clarity in the field of screen accessibility, signo was developed in a month.

signo encloses information which was gathered among many publications, such as W3C, WebAIM, Medium, Orange, Microsoft, Material.io, etc. This knowledge was rewritten in order to be easily understandable, and served in a way which aims to be widely spread.

## Contribute to a more open world of inclusiveness

## What's behind signo?

The signo initiative was brought to life by me, Mathieu Delvaux, a [DWM](http://dwm.re) student, as part of my final project.

I'm a multidisciplinary designer from Belgium and currently studying in my final year at Albert Jacquard College.
I'm also the Co-Founder & Creative UX Manager of [nextmoov](https://nextmoov.be), the Co-Founder & Product Design Manager of [NextRide](https://nextride.be/about) and a former design intern at [EPIC Agency](https://epic.net).
