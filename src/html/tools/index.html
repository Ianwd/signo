          <h3>What is signo?</h3>
          <p>
            Signo is an initiative developed as a toolbox to help anyone design and develop accessible experiences for screens. Inclusiveness is currently not part of most of design processes, and that is what signo is aiming to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accessiblity is what allows people with impairments to enjoy a meaningful screen experience, from their computer to their phone. Although guidelines have been defined, few people know about them. Crafting for everyone involves a particular understanding, which then comes as a habit.
